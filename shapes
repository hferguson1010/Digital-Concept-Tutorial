# Drawing Shapes

SVG gives you some basic shapes that you can draw using simple tags.
Each shape can be made with an element such as `<rect>`, `<circle>`, or `<line>`.

## Rectangle
A rectangle is one of the most simple SVG shapes

```html
<rect x="10" y="10" width="100" height="50" fill="orange" />

## Circle 
```html
<circle cx="60" cy="60" r="30" fill="skyblue" />

## Line
```html
<line x1="10" y1="10" x2="110" y2="10" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
