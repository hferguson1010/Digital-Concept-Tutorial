# What is SVG?

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a way to draw a graphic using a basic text based markup.
Since SVG uses vectors instead of pixels:

- It scales to whaterver size you'd like without losing quality
- It can be styled with CSS
- It works in every single modern browser
- You can edit it in any text editor such as notepad

Example SVG
```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="60 cy="60" r="40" fill="lightblue" />
</svg>
